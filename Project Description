Website Builder is a python project in which I will be using TKinter along with HTML Parser python libraries. 
The program will allow the user to use a WYSIWYG editor to generate websites based off of templates. The user
will also be able to drag and drop items in the template to match their preferences. The program will then generate 
html and css files to match what the user made.
